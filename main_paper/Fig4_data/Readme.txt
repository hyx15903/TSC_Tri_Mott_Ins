extended t-J-Jchi triangular model main paper Fig. 4

The files "jx0.05j2{j2}/m10000Lx48/Sc_cor1.dat" contains the SC pairing correlation data for J2=j2, Jchi=0.05, Ly=4, Lx=48, doping=1/12, bond dimension=10000

the 4th column for the distance in the x-direction between i and j.
The 5th column stands for the b-b bond SC correlations, 6th column the b-a bond, 7th column the b-c bond.
The 8th column stand for the SC pairing phase between b-b bond, 9th column b-a bond, 10th column b-c bond


The files "jx0.05j2{j2}/m10000Lx48/density_cor.dat" contains the density correlation data
The 3rd column stands for the distance x between i and j site, and the 4th column the correlation the 5th column is the density on i site, the 6th column is the density on j site.


The files "jx0.05j2{j2}/m10000Lx48/elec_cor.dat" contains the density correlation data
The 3rd column stands for the distance x between i and j site, and the 4th column the real part of the correlation.

The files "jx0.05j2{j2}/m10000Lx48/spin_cor.dat" contains the density correlation data
The 3rd column stands for the distance x between i and j site, and the 4th column the real part of the correlation.
