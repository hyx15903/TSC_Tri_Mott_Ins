extended t-J-Jchi triangular model main paper Fig. 7

The files "Kspace_tJ_Spin_Stru_Nx36Ny6j2{J2}jk{Jx}SU2.txt" contains the spin structure factor for different kx, ky at J2=J2, Jx=Jx


The first column stands for the kx, the second column the ky, the third column the structure factor.



To compile, run "plotSqMap_Sq.m" file in Matlab.
